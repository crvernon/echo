# echo
A Python package to launch ensembles of GCAM runs

## Purpose

`echo` was created to:
    - Intuitively set up and launch large ensembles of GCAM runs on an HPC cluster
    - Support high communication frequency, two-way coupling, multi-model experiments
    - Provide optimized support for scaling large experiments out-of-the-box
